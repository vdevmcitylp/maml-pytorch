# maml-pytorch

This repository is an implementation of [Model Agnostic Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400) by Finn et al. in PyTorch.

Currently, the code supports first-order MAML & Sinusoid Regression.

### Requirements

Code tested with pytorch version: 1.2.0+cpu and Python 3.5.

### Acknowledgments

[This](https://towardsdatascience.com/advances-in-few-shot-learning-reproducing-results-in-pytorch-aba70dee541d) blog post by [Oscar Knagg](https://github.com/oscarknagg) helped me immensely.

### Usage

<<<<<<< HEAD
	python main.py

Hyperparameters can be set in config.yml.

To check tensorboard, open up a command prompt and enter,
	
	tensorboard --logdir=tensorboard-runs/<run_id>
=======
TODO:
- [ ] Write meta-testing code
- [ ] Adding meta-training code in maml.py
- [ ] Write code for 2nd order MAML
- [ ] Write usage instructions in README
- [ ] Write a notebook for better explanation (Required?)
